rem This file should be called by a GPO with three parameters:

rem   SITE_CODE
rem   DOMAIN_NAME or AUTO
rem eg. 100 ORCHID



set SITE_CODE=%1%
set DOMAIN=%2%


rem Change the name of the source if required
set EVENT_SOURCE=N-central agent installer

rem If you've changed the strAgentFolder variable in the VBS file, change this line as well
set AGENT_FOLDER=Agent

rem If the domain name is set as AUTO, we can now automatically detect it
if "%DOMAIN%"=="AUTO" ( wmic computersystem get domain | findstr /i . > %TEMP%\IA_dom.txt
			for /f "tokens=*" %%d in (%TEMP%\IA_dom.txt) do SET DOMAIN=%%d )
